Project Overview:
In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) that combines information from all over the company. Your data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea beverages sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as your career progresses, the core principles remain the same.

Scenario:
You're a junior BI developer who's just been hired by the Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) up near Seattle, Washington (USA).

It's a small, but growing company, and the CFO is eager to get some help translating all the disjointed sales files and product records into something usable so that they can help the owners make sense of what is generating not only sales but profitability.

It's common knowledge that the flagship tea beverage, Bamboo Grove Tea is the company's biggest seller.

But what about the rest?

The way the data is collected in-house, they are not even sure whether all the products are generating a profit at this stage.
Seven Sages teas are sold in Washington State (USD) and British Columbia (CAD), so there's a currency consideration as well.
The company runs on a fiscal calendar. So make sure you factor that into your efforts when you build the model.
